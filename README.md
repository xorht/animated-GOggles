summary: Go project I would like to share from my programming language course in undergrad.

This project was carried out most likely in the span of a month.

I had no prior experience with Go before this assignment, but I really enjoyed it.

I tried to make my program in a way that made sense and in an extendable way.

I enjoyed writing this code and just would like to share it. I hope anyone reading can find some enjoyment in it too.

To run: Use `go run .` or `go run <path_to_project>`

Note: default data file is named data.txt
